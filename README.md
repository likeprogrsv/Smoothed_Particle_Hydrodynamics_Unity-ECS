# Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics_Unity-ECS
An attempt to apply smoothed particle hydrodynamics for forecasting oil and gas potential.

The work of LeonardoMontes is taken as a basis: https://github.com/leonardo-montes/Unity-ECS-Job-System-SPH.

The project was to be the basis for the development of scientific work on the forecast of the channels of the Middle Jurassic period.
